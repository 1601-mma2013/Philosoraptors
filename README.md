2. Modeling

a. Personas

Ms. Carol is an unmarried 33 year-old special educational needs teacher. As a Mathematics educator specialising in geometry, she seeks a new teaching environment for her students. She soon realises that there is a flaw in the current teaching method which requires the use of 3D printers, leading to a problem whereby her students would be unable to use the 3D printing software via computer during lessons. In spite of their blindness, with the 3Doodler and proper guide, they are still able to draw by themselves and learn as they go. She hopes to engage her students’ attention by finding a more interactive way of producing a fun, creative and hands-on learning process. As a result, the 3Doodler would empower both interactivity and interaction in class. It would also establish a newfound motivation for their overall attitude and aptitude.

II. Synthesis

1. Requirements Definition

a. Context Scenarios

1) An hour before Carol’s geometry class at her workplace, a special needs school, she would practice using her 3Doodler that she bought online from their official website for a better handling of the 3D pen so that she is able to use it to teach her students in class whereby they are blind and visually impaired.

2)  In the classroom, Carol demonstrates various geometrical shapes like spheres, cones, pyramids and rectangles by constructing three-dimensional figures with a ruler to get the correct shape measurements. She then continues to explain the shape, size as well as relative position of the polygons.

3) She also gives a hands-on practice to students to use the 3Doodler to construct geometrical shapes by themselves in order to have a better understanding of geometry. At the same time, she also guides her students how to use the pen correctly one by one. This also creates a new method of human-technology interaction in the classroom.

b. Requirements

**Power Switch:**
- Located on the side of the pen.
- Used to turn the pen's temperature settings to high or low, as well as 'off'.

**Power Indicator Light:**
- Shines in three different colors: starts out red (high), turns green (low).
- Proper temperature on the high setting it turns blue.
- Extrusion buttons only function when the light is green or blue.
- Enter sleep mode after five minutes.

**Nozzle:**
- Tip of the 3Doodler, and the piece that heats up to melt the plastic.

**Power Port:**
- Hole on the right hand side to plug in included power adapter.

**Plastic Loader:**
- Hole to insert the 3Doodler plastic strands.

**Air Vent:**
- Airflow to ensure that the plastic comes out at just the right temperature to solidify as quickly as possible.

**Extrusion Control (fast):**
- This is the larger of the two buttons on the front face of the 3Doodler. With a gentle push you will feel the button click.

**Extrusion Control (slow):**
- Extrudes plastic at a very slow and steady rate.
- Can be used to create very fine and precise detail.
- Great for drawing up into the air.

**Extrusion Control (continuous):**
- Double-click to initiate a continuous extrusion.
- Click once to stop, or click and hold to pause.
- Hold the button down to pause, it will stop extruding until the button is released.
- Pressing both buttons simultaneously to reverse the plastic out of the 3Doodler.

**Temperature Control:**
- Power Switch can be used to adjust the temperature on either heat setting.
- Turn it 90° to the right to crank up the heat, or 90° to the left to turn it down.

**Control Port:**
- Three pin port that can be used to attach 3Doodler accessories.
