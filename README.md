2. Modeling

a. Personas

Ms. Carol is an unmarried 33 year-old special educational needs teacher. As a Mathematics educator specialising in geometry, she seeks a new teaching environment for her students. She soon realises that there is a flaw in the current teaching method which requires the use of 3D printers, leading to a problem whereby her students would be unable to use the 3D printing software via computer during lessons. In spite of their blindness, with the 3Doodler and proper guide, they are still able to draw by themselves and learn as they go. She hopes to engage her students’ attention by finding a more interactive way of producing a fun, creative and hands-on learning process. As a result, the 3Doodler would empower both interactivity and interaction in class. It would also establish a newfound motivation for their overall attitude and aptitude.

II. Synthesis

1. Requirements Definition

a. Context Scenarios

1 An hour before Carol’s geometry class in a Special Needs School, she would practice using her 3Doodler that she bought online from their official website for a better handling of the 3D pen so that she is able to use it to teach her students in class which the students are blind and visually impaired. 

2  While her students are in class, Carol demonstrates various geometrical shapes like spheres, cones, pyramids and rectangles by constructing three-dimensional figures with a ruler to measure the correct angle of the shapes. She then continues to explain the shape, size as well as relative position of the polygons.

3 She also gives a hands-on practice to students to use the 3Doodler to construct geometrical shapes by themselves in order to have a better understanding of geometrical shapes. At the same time, she also guides the students on how to use the pen correctly one by one. This also creates a new method of human-computer interaction in the classroom.
